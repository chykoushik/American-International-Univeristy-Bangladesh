 Gerrard headed past Rob Green in the 87th minute having missed a penalty with the score at 1-1.

Philippe Coutinho put the Reds ahead with a great strike before Leroy Fer volleyed in.

Nedum Onuoha was shown a second yellow, before Gerrard's winner left QPR one defeat away from relegation.

Both sets of players wore black armbands after the announcement before the match that QPR defender Rio Ferdinand's wife had died following a battle against breast cancer.

Gerrard also presented Hoops midfielder Joey Barton with a bouquet of flowers to give to Ferdinand.
